Core principles:
- Please follow the code style of the existing code.
- Please design with scalability and extensibility in mind.
- When suggesting edits, please keep your implementation concise.

Workflow guidelines:
- After completing implementation, please update README.md, CLAUDE.md, and other documentation as needed.
- After implementing changes to API endpoints, please update Bruno collections accordingly.

Implementation guidelines:
- Always use the existing virtual environment (venv) when running python commands.
- Always use strong typing when managing/implementing objects as opposed to dicts.
- Always use Python type hints.

JSON Schema Evolution:
- Always include a `schema_version` field in JSONField structures that may evolve over time.
- When changing a JSON schema, increment the version and add backward compatibility logic.
- Never rely on the presence/absence of specific keys to determine schema version - use explicit version field.
- Document schema changes in docstrings with version history.
